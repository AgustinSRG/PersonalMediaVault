## Pull Requests

If you implemented a new feature, or fixed a bug, and want to share your contribution to this repository, you may open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/AgustinSRG/PersonalMediaVault/pulls).

 - Your code **must pass the tests without any errors or warnings**. The the `README.md` files of each folder to know how tu run the tests.
 - Your code **must work**. Make sure to test it before submitting it.
 - Your code **must be complete**. Do not submit the pull request before completing the implementation.
 - Your pull request **must not change any unrelated parts of the code**. Review your code change before submitting, and revert any changes you do not want to submit.

### Tips

When making changes to the code, here are some tips you can follow:

 - Read the available documentation of the [project components](https://github.com/AgustinSRG/PersonalMediaVault?tab=readme-ov-file#project-components). This is mainly in form of `README.md` files.
 - When you write a commit name, describe what your commit does. Do not use commit names like `Update main.js` or `Changes`.
